title: Visits to Lille Vildmose - Moose, Red Deer, and the Dream of a Golden Eagle
date: 2025-10-20
---
I keep returning to **Lille Vildmose** in **Himmerland**, south of **Aalborg** and close to **Øster Hurup**. It is a landscape of raised bogs, reed beds and wide skies. Many visits are simple: park the car, wait with the windows slightly open, listen, and let the light decide what happens next. The wildlife here is used to cars, which often makes quiet waiting the best approach.

I have seen **moose (elk)**, **red deer**, **cranes** and **white-tailed eagle**. Some encounters have been close, all of them calm. I still have two goals on my list: **golden eagle** and **wolf**. With autumn and winter ahead, I will try again.

## Field notes from recent visits

- **Moose and red deer** show well at first light and before dusk. The open peat and birch edges give long sightlines from the car.  
- **Cranes** announce themselves before they appear. If the calls grow stronger, I stop and wait.  
- **White-tailed eagle** has crossed my path a few times. I am still looking for **golden eagle**.  
- **Wolf** is the long shot. Tracks and reports surface from time to time, so I watch conditions and timing.

If you want a feel for the light and mood I look for, here are two related works:  
- **Red deer:** [**Golden Levitation**](https://redowlphoto.dk/works/golden-levitation/)  
- **Grazing cattle** that help manage the reserve: [**The Cows of Lille Vildmose**](https://redowlphoto.dk/works/the-cows-of-lille-vildmose/)

## Seasons and a small plan

I log each visit with notes on weather, wind, and **sunrise and sunset times**, then return to the same viewpoints across the year. If I manage to build a strong set from all four seasons, I am considering a **Lille Vildmose calendar for 2027**.  
Until then, you can explore my current work from the nearby area here: [**Mariagerfjord Calendar 2026**](https://redowlphoto.dk/categories/calendar-2026/)

## Visiting notes

- **Location:** Lille Vildmose in **Himmerland**, south of **Aalborg**, near **Øster Hurup**  
- **Best times:** dawn and late afternoon. Autumn mist and winter frost add atmosphere  
- **Approach:** slow driving on approved roads, long stops with the engine off, use of hides where available. Keep distance and let the animals set the rhythm

If you need a warm break, or you are more interested in the area’s history and wildlife, I recommend a visit to [**Lille Vildmosecentret**](https://lillevildmose.dk/).

*I will keep returning through the colder months. Maybe this is the year a golden eagle passes the horizon, or a wolf leaves more than a footprint.*
