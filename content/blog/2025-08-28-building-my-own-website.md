How do you like it?

Building this website has been a long and sometimes frustrating process. What begins with registering a domain and picking a provider soon turns into questions about design, structure and tools. At several points I was close to losing patience, especially when working with an AI helper that alternated between saving hours of work and sending me down rabbit holes of trial and error.

But the real goal was clear from the start – I needed a site where adding new content would be easy. I’m not a programmer, so I wanted a system where I could upload new photos, create categories and write blog posts directly from the site’s own interface. No coding, no hidden files, just a simple way to keep the site alive and updated.

That part has been worth the effort. The homepage, about section and blog are now connected so I can expand as I go. Whether it’s a new series of photos or a short story behind an image, I can publish it within minutes.

The journey here wasn’t always smooth, but the result is practical: a site that grows with me instead of standing still.
