title: “Newborn Moon” – Global Photographer of the Year
date: 2025-10-09

In September 2025, during the lunar eclipse over the Kattegat, I captured a moment that would later travel further than I imagined.

From a small hill near Als in Mariagerfjord, I waited as clouds rolled in and covered the rising moon. For a long time, nothing happened. The sky was heavy and dim, and most people who had come to see the blood moon went home. I stayed.  
Eventually, the moon appeared through the mist, still touched by the red shadow of the eclipse. It looked almost newborn, as if emerging from the clouds themselves. That fragile illusion became the heart of the image, and its name: **“Newborn Moon.”**

## Recognition a month later

One month later, the photograph was awarded **Global Photographer of the Year (Amateur)** by the **International Awards Associate (IAA)** at the [Global Photography Awards 2025](https://www.muse.world/index.php/post/2025-global-photography-awards-honors-outstanding-photographers-category-winners-of-the-year).  
Over 2,500 entries from more than 45 countries were submitted, making the recognition feel both surreal and humbling.

The international photo magazine **121clicks.com** described the work as *“a calm, celestial shot that reminds us how small and yet infinite life can feel.”*  
For me, that quiet tension between vastness and intimacy is exactly what photography is about, distilling something infinite into a moment you can hold.

## A Nordic perspective

I’ve always been drawn to stillness, the kind you find near water at dawn or in fog that hides the horizon.  
The places that inspire my work are all close to home: **Mariager Fjord, Øster Hurup, Als Odde**, where the light is gentle, the air clear, and the landscapes unfold slowly.

“Newborn Moon” continues that story. It’s not about spectacle but about patience, about waiting for light to reveal something quiet yet profound.  
That’s the approach I bring to all my work: minimalism as a way of listening.

*Photography sometimes gives back more than you expect, not through prizes, but through moments that remind you why you stayed in the cold waiting for light.*
