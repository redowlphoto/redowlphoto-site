Mariager Fjord has a special kind of silence in the early morning.

At Hadsund, the water can be perfectly still, with only a faint ripple breaking the reflection. That was the feeling behind *Solitude at Mariager Fjord* – a moment of calm that now lives as a photograph:

Further out at Als Odde, the fjord greets the sun differently. On that morning, a small boat drifted across the golden light of dawn, and *Golden Morning* became the story of how light and water can paint together:

**From sunrise to fine art print**

Both “Solitude at Mariager Fjord” and “Golden Morning” are now available as fine art prints. 


Send me a message if you would like more information, pricing, or to order a print for your home. Each print is made with archival quality and shipped ready to bring a piece of Mariager Fjord’s quiet mornings into your space.

They carry with them the atmosphere of Mariager Fjord at sunrise, the quiet, the light, and the stillness that defines this place.

If you are looking for a Mariager Fjord art print, these works are my way of sharing the fjord’s mornings in a lasting form.

Photographed at Hadsund and Als Odde, Mariager Fjord, Denmark.
