There are places where light makes the landscape truly special. In Denmark, many people associate this with Skagen, but for me, **Als Odde by Mariager Fjord** is just as magical. The light is constantly shifting – soft in the mornings, golden at sunset – and it makes every day unique.

It is my favorite place to photograph because the moods change endlessly. I often return to the weathered wooden poles, the boats resting on the water, and the birdlife that shifts from day to day. As the sun rises, the fjord slowly awakens: herons stand still in the shallows, swans glide by, and gulls call overhead. Occasionally, a great egret or even a seal will appear – small glimpses of nature’s own poetry.

And then there are the boats. On early mornings you can see small fishing boats heading out to sea, or sailing boats setting their course toward the horizon. All of it bathed in the golden light that spreads across the fjord and out over the Kattegat.

Here are some of my photographs from Als Odde:

- [Golden Dawn – Sunrise over Als Odde](https://redowlphoto.dk/works/golden-dawn-1--sunrise-over-als-odde-mariager-fjord/)

These images capture the variation of light that makes this place so fascinating. One moment the fjord glows in warm golden tones, the next the world rests quietly in cool pastel shades. For me, it is an endless source of inspiration – a place where nature, calm, and light come together.
