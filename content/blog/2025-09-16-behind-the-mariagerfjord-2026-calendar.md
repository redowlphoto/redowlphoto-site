*Seasons shift, light changes, and the fjord tells a different story each month.*  
That was the idea behind creating my new **Mariagerfjord Calendar 2026** â€“ a collection of images captured over the past year, now brought together in a fine art calendar.

For me, Mariager Fjord and the surrounding coastlines around **Hadsund, Als Odde, and Ã˜ster Hurup** are places of constant inspiration. Misty spring mornings by the **fjord in Himmerland**, glowing summer sunsets over the **Kattegat coast**, autumn storms rolling in from the sea and quiet winter stillness â€” each photograph reflects the atmosphere of its season.  

To produce the calendar, I used Saal Digitalâ€™s software, which allowed me to design the layout and ensure the images flowed naturally from one month to the next. The result is more than just a series of pictures; itâ€™s a journey through a year by the fjord, showing how light and mood transform the same landscapes over time.  

ðŸ‘‰ You can now view and order the calendar directly here:

You can also explore the calendar as a featured work on my own site here:

I hope it brings a touch of Nordic calm and seasonal atmosphere into your everyday life.
