## About

{{< portrait src="portrait.jpg" alt="Allan Andersen, RedOwlPhoto" >}}
I am **Allan Andersen** – the photographer behind **RedOwlPhoto**.  
I create quiet, pared-back photographs guided by **minimalism** and a **modernist eye for form**. Simple lines, open horizons, and muted colour keep space and stillness in the frame. The aim is always to remove distraction so the mood of a place can surface.  

Most of my work is from **Denmark’s east coast** around **Mariager Fjord, Als Odde, and Øster Hurup**, with ongoing series exploring light and atmosphere elsewhere in Scandinavia.  

In 2025, my photograph *“Newborn Moon”* was awarded **Global Photographer of the Year (Amateur)** by the **International Awards Associate (IAA)**. My work has also been featured by international photo platforms and the **Danish Photographic Society (SDF)**, reflecting a continued dialogue between Nordic stillness and global recognition.

## Prints & Licensing

My photographs can be licensed for **editorial and commercial use**.  
I also offer **fine-art prints** on request (museum-grade papers, signed/numbered).  
Please email [hello@redowlphoto.dk](mailto:hello@redowlphoto.dk) with the work title, intended use or size, and any deadlines.
