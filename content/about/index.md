## About


{{< portrait src="portrait.jpg" alt="Allan Andersen, RedOwlPhoto" >}}
I am **Allan Andersen** – the photographer behind **RedOwlPhoto**.  
I create quiet, pared-back photographs guided by **minimalism** and a **modernist eye for form**. Simple lines, open horizons, and muted colour keep space and stillness in the frame. The aim is always to remove distraction so the mood of a place can surface.  


Most of my work is from **Denmark’s east coast** around **Mariager Fjord, Als Odde, and Øster Hurup**, with ongoing series exploring light and atmosphere elsewhere in Scandinavia.  


## Awards & Press

In 2025 I won **Global Photographer of the Year (Amateur)** for *Newborn Moon*.  
See the winning entry on the **Global Photography Awards** site:

[“A Sense of Stillness: Capturing Denmark’s Coastal Calm”](https://www.muse.world/post/a-sense-of-stillness-capturing-denmarks-coastal-calm-with-allan-andersen)

My work has also been featured by international photo platforms and the **Danish Photographic Society (SDF)**, reflecting a continued dialogue between Nordic stillness and global recognition.
