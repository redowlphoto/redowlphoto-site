Pastel sunset colors settle over Mariager Fjord on a quiet March evening at Als Odde, North Jutland.  

The wooden poles rising from the water reflect in the calm fjord, creating a meditative stillness â€“ a minimalist seascape where nature, light, and silence meet.  

This photograph captures the timeless atmosphere of the Himmerland coast, part of Denmarkâ€™s east coast, where Mariager Fjord, Als Odde, and nearby Hadsund shape the Nordic landscape.  

It is available as a **Mariager Fjord art print**, combining pastel sky tones with Scandinavian minimalist fine art photography.
