Pastel sunset colors settle over Mariager Fjord on a quiet March evening at Als Odde, North Jutland.  

The wooden poles rising from the water reflect in the calm fjord, creating a meditative stillness – a minimalist seascape where nature, light, and silence meet.  

This photograph captures the timeless atmosphere of the Himmerland coast, part of Denmark’s east coast, where Mariager Fjord, Als Odde, and nearby Hadsund shape the Nordic landscape.  

It is available as a **Mariager Fjord art print**, combining pastel sky tones with Scandinavian minimalist fine art photography.
