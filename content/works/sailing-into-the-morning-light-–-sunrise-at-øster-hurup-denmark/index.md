On a calm summer sunrise at Øster Hurup on the Kattegat coast, a sailboat drifts across still water under a pastel-colored sky.  

This minimalist seascape photograph captures Øster Hurup sunrise, Kattegat coast photography, and the quiet beauty of Mariager Fjord near Hadsund, Als Odde and Himmerland.  
The scene reflects the atmosphere of North Jutland’s coastline, combining Danish minimalist seascape style with Scandinavian fine art photography.  

It highlights how simple moments at sea can become timeless – now available as a Øster Hurup sunrise art print and Danish seascape wall art.
