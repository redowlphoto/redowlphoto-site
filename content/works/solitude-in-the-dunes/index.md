A minimalist landscape photograph of Råbjerg Mile, the largest migrating sand dune in Northern Europe, located near Skagen in North Jutland, Denmark.

Captured on an August day, the image shows a single person seated in solitude amid the vast shifting sands, beneath a wide cloudy sky.

The scene reflects the scale and quietude of Denmark’s desert-like coastal landscapes, where sky and sand merge into a meditative stillness.
