On a quiet May evening, a mute swan glides across the pastel-colored surface of Mariager Fjord.

The calm spring light reflects gently in the water, creating a serene atmosphere typical of Himmerlandâ€™s fjords.

Capturing both the elegance of the swan and the unique seasonal light, this scene highlights the subtle beauty of **North Jutland** in springtime.
