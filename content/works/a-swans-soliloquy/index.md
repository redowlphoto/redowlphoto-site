On a quiet May morning, a mute swan glides across the pastel-colored surface of Mariager Fjord.

The calm spring light reflects gently in the water, creating a serene atmosphere typical of Himmerland’s fjords.

Capturing both the elegance of the swan and the unique seasonal light, this work highlights the subtle beauty of North Jutland in springtime.
