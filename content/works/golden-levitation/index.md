A red deer stag steps through the marsh as if weightless — the **golden hour** fog at **Lille Vildmose** (Himmerland, near **Aalborg**) lifts from the ground and turns the first light into a veil. With distance reduced to tone and silhouette, the animal seems to **levitate**.

Selected as *Photo of the Day* on One Eyeland.

This work sits at the intersection of minimalism and wildlife: a single subject, one palette, and the quiet drama of dawn.
