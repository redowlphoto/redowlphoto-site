An August sunrise at Als Odde on the Kattegat coast, where a small boat leaves the shore and glides across the calm water of Mariager Fjord.

The golden morning light reflects over Hadsundâ€™s coastal horizon, capturing both the stillness of the fjord and the timeless rhythm of summer life in Himmerland.

This scene highlights the meeting of human activity and Nordic nature in North Jutland.
