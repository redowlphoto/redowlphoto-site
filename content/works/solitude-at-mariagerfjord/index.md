A minimalist seascape from Mariager Fjord near Hadsund, captured on a quiet spring morning.

Soft mist drifts over the fjord as calm water mirrors a single boat, creating an atmosphere of solitude and reflection.

This work emphasizes the Nordic sense of stillness where landscape, light, and silence meet.
