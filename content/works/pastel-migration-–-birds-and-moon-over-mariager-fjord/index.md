location: Mariager Fjord – Hadsund, Himmerland, North Jutland, Denmark
caption: On a clear November day by Mariager Fjord, a flock of migrating birds
  crosses the sky beneath the pale moon. The soft pastel tones and sense of
  movement reflect the rhythm of nature along Himmerland’s coast – a place where
  seasons and light tell their own quiet stories.
