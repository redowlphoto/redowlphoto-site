On a clear November day above **Mariager Fjord** in Himmerland, a flock of migrating birds crosses the sky beneath the pale moon.

The soft autumn light and pastel tones capture the seasonal rhythm of nature along North Jutland’s coastline, a reminder of how the changing months shape Denmark’s landscapes.

This work highlights the quiet beauty of bird migration, the interplay of moonlight and atmosphere, and the timeless calm of the fjord.
