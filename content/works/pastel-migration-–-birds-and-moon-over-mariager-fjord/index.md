On a clear November day above **Mariager Fjord** in Himmerland, a flock of migrating birds crosses the sky beneath the pale moon.

The soft autumn light and pastel tones capture the seasonal rhythm of nature along North Jutlandâ€™s coastline, a reminder of how the changing months shape Denmarkâ€™s landscapes.

This work highlights the quiet beauty of bird migration, the interplay of moonlight and atmosphere, and the timeless calm of the fjord.
