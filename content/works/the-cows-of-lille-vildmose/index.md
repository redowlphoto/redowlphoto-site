Two cows graze in a glowing field as the **golden hour** fog at **Lille Vildmose** (Himmerland, near **Aalborg**) erases distance and detail. With backlight turning mist into radiance, the animals seem to fade into light rather than landscape.

This image leans into pastoral minimalism: a reduced palette, simple shapes, and the quiet rhythm of morning.
