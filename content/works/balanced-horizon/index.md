A minimalist seascape from Øster Hurup on the Kattegat coast, captured on a calm March morning.

Morning mist drifts in from the north, while the soft light of sunrise is partly veiled by haze, and reflections spread gently across the still water.

This photograph captures the quiet beauty of Øster Hurup and Mariager Fjord’s coastal villages – the timeless atmosphere of North Jutland and the ever-changing light of Himmerland.

Available as a fine art print, it reflects the sense of calm and stillness that defines Denmark’s east coast.
