A minimalist seascape from Øster Hurup on the Kattegat coast, captured on a calm early morning. 

Sea mist drifts in from the north, soft sunlight is partly veiled by haze, and reflections spread across the still water. 

This August scene reflects the quiet beauty of Mariager Fjord’s coastal villages and the changing light of Himmerland.
