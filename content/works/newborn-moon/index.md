  This photograph captures the lunar eclipse of September 2025. At first, the
  clouds hid the moon as it rose above the Kattegat, but eventually it appeared
  through the mist - giving the illusion of a celestial birth.


  The image, titled **“Newborn Moon,”** was awarded *Global Photographer of the Year (Amateur)* at the **2025 Global Photography Awards**, organized by the International Awards Associate (IAA).

A minimalist nightscape from **Als**, by the **Kattegat coast** in **Mariagerfjord municipality, Denmark**, captured during the **lunar eclipse of September 2025**.  

The clouds first concealed the rising moon, but as it appeared above the mist it seemed almost *newborn* — a celestial body emerging from the darkness. This rare moment combined cosmic drama with **Nordic stillness**, turning an astronomical event into a quiet meditation on **light, shadow, and beginnings**.  

The photograph reflects the essence of **Scandinavian minimalism and fine art landscape photography** — where silence, atmosphere, and simplicity transform even the night sky into a story of reflection and wonder.
