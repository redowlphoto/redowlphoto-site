  This photograph captures the lunar eclipse of September 2025. At first, the

A minimalist nightscape from Als by the Kattegat coast in Mariagerfjord municipality, captured during the lunar eclipse of September 2025.  

The clouds first hid the rising moon, but as it emerged above the mist it appeared almost newborn — a celestial body rising from the darkness. The scene blends cosmic drama with Nordic stillness, turning a rare astronomical event into a meditation on light, shadow, and beginnings.  

This work emphasizes the Scandinavian sense of atmosphere, where silence and simplicity transform even the night sky into a story of reflection and wonder.
