An August sunrise at Als Odde on the Kattegat coast, where the rising sun paints Mariager Fjord in glowing gold.

A sailboat drifts on the horizon, embodying the freedom of summer mornings by Hadsund and the quiet beauty of the Himmerland coast.

This scene captures the timeless rhythm of North Jutland’s fjords, where golden light meets the still waters of Denmark’s east coast.
