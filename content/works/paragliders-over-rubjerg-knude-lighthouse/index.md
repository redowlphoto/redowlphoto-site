Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse stands on the shifting dunes of Lønstrup in **Vendsyssel**, overlooking the dramatic North Sea coast of Denmark.

Captured on a late July day, this photograph shows the lighthouse framed by sandy dunes in the foreground and two paragliders soaring above in a clear blue summer sky.

The scene highlights both the raw beauty of North Jutland’s coastal landscapes and the outdoor activities that define this part of Scandinavia.
