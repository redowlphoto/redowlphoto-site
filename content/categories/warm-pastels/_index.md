At the edges of day, colour loosens: pink haze over still water, a pale band of

gold above the horizon, thin clouds catching the last light. I chase these

short windows with gentle shutter speeds and uncluttered compositions so the

light itself can breathe. The mood is open and inviting rather than dramatic,

favouring calm water, low wind and simple foregrounds. Boats, poles and dunes

become quiet anchors for the changing sky.

This series collects pastel-toned dawns and dusks from Mariager Fjord to

Øster Hurup—photographs made to hold warmth, not noise.
