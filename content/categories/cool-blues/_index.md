Blue hour pares the landscape down to tone and line. Before sunrise and after

sunset, the sea and sky settle into cool gradients where small shifts in light

matter more than detail. I work slowly here—long exposures, simple horizons,

and a restrained palette—to let calm water and distant shorelines become the

subject. The photographs are less about place than about a temperature of

light; winter dawns at Mariager Fjord, soft evenings on the Kattegat, and the

quiet in between. Minimal elements—a buoy, a jetty, a single boat—give scale

without breaking the spell.

This series gathers blue-hour studies that explore silence, balance and the

subtle distances of Denmark’s coast.
