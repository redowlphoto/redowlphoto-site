description: "Minimalist seascapes from Mariager Fjord, Øster Hurup and the Kattegat coast."

Along the shores of Mariager Fjord and the open Kattegat, the sea is rarely dramatic.  
Most days are quiet: long horizons, pastel light and a gentle tide that turns boats, poles
and birds into simple graphic forms. This collection gathers photographs made in Hadsund,
Als Odde and Øster Hurup—places where the coast feels spacious and uncluttered. I work
at dawn and dusk when colour is soft and the water is calm, aiming for a clean, timeless
expression with room to breathe. The motifs are familiar—buoys, sailing boats, distant
islands—yet reduced to their essence by light and weather. If you enjoy serene images,
this is the part of Denmark where minimalism comes naturally.
