Golden Hour is my series made in the brief window around sunrise and sunset, when light turns soft, warm, and sculpting. Here you’ll find minimalist scenes from Denmark — Mariager Fjord, the Kattegat coast, and Himmerland around Aalborg and Lille Vildmose — where fog, low sun, and gentle color transitions simplify the view.

The series brings together landscape and wildlife in one calm palette. Explore related categories: [Wildlife](/categories/wildlife/) and [Sea & Fjord](/categories/sea-fjord/).
