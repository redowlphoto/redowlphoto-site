“Curated Picks” is a personal edit across projects: images chosen for how they

speak together rather than where they were made. Some are spare and nearly

abstract; others lean on gesture—a bird’s flight, a boat’s slow line—to carry

the scene. Each photograph is included for balance of mood, light and craft:

clear intention, simple structure, and room for the viewer to linger.

This series highlights a handful of works that feel most like me—quiet

pictures with long aftertastes.

All photos have been selected, curated or awarded by galleries or in photo contests.
