North Jutland’s dunes are always moving. At Rubjerg Knude the lighthouse stands above
steep, windswept ridges; at Råbjerg Mile the sand drifts like a slow river across the
heath. I photograph these places in soft light to emphasise form and scale—lines, curves
and the meeting of sand and sky. People appear only occasionally, to suggest a sense of
distance. The palette is restrained and the compositions simple, allowing the landscape
to feel quiet despite its size. This series gathers studies of texture, light and space
from Lønstrup to Skagen and beyond.
