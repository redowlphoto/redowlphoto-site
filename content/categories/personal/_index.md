Not every photograph needs to be grand. These are walks, tests and quiet finds:

a change in weather, a colour that won’t let go, a composition tried three

different ways. I keep the camera light and the expectations lighter, using

this space to explore approaches that may later grow into larger series—or

simply remain as honest observations. Imperfections are welcome; the point is

to stay curious.

This series gathers small, personal notes from the shoreline—work in

conversation with the finished photographs.

And, they all feature me or my dog Trille
